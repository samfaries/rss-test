23059,Bagdad,Solar PV, Duke Energy Renewables Acquires Two Arizona Solar Farms,"Duke Energy now owns two large-scale solar farms in Arizona  the companys first in the American West.    Duke Energy Renewables, a commercial business unit of Duke Energy, purchased the Ajo Solar Project and Bagdad Solar Project from Recurrent Energy in August. Arizona Public Service Co. (APS) will buy all of the output from both solar farms from Duke Energy Renewables under the terms of two 25-year power purchase agreements. (APS originally signed these agreements with Recurrent Energy.)    The Ajo Solar Project, located in Pima County (near the community of Ajo), uses nearly 21,000 photovoltaic (PV) solar panels that can collectively generate almost 5 megawatts (MW) of electricity. The project achieved commercial operation in late September.    The Bagdad Solar Project, located in Yavapai County (near the town of Bagdad), will use about 72,000 solar panels that can collectively generate 15 MW of electricity. The project is expected to achieve commercial operation by the end of this year.    This acquisition puts Duke Energy in a position to help Arizonas largest and longest-serving energy service provider deliver even more affordable, zero-emission renewable power to its customers, said Duke Energy Renewables President Greg Wolf. For Duke Energy, this landmark deal doubles our portfolio of commercial solar projects in operation and instantly expands our footprint to the western United States.    These projects represent an important step in realizing our mission to establish solar as a mainstream source of electricity, said Arno Harris, CEO of Recurrent Energy. Were thrilled to have a partner of Duke Energys caliber step into the ownership role for these innovative solar projects.    Financial terms were not disclosed.    International engineering and project management company AMEC designed and built the Ajo and Bagdad projects. AMEC will be responsible for operating and maintaining the sites under the terms of five-year service agreements with Duke Energy Renewables.    Duke Energy Renewables already owns seven PV facilities in operation: a 14-MW solar farm in San Antonio, Texas, a 6-MW project in Orlando, Fla., and five 1-MW sites in North Carolina. The company is building a 5-MW facility in Murfreesboro, N.C. In addition, Duke Energy Renewables owns more than 1,000 MW of electric-generating capacity at 10 U.S. wind farms. Since 2007, Duke Energy has invested more than $1.75 billion to grow its commercial wind and solar business lines."

40987,Watson Seed Farm PV1,Solar PV, Ecoplexus finances project as North Carolina PV expansion continues,"Developer Ecoplexus has closed financing that will allow it to construct a 25MW PV plant in North Carolina, its ninth project in the leading solar state in the US Southeast.    The San Francisco-based company did not identify lending sources or financial terms of the deal.    The project in Whitakers in northeastern North Carolina will utilize 150,000 modeules from Japan's Solar Frontier and achieve commercial operation later this year.    That will qualify it for both the state and federal renewable energy investment tax credits. The state 35% ITC for solar will sunset on 31 December, while the 30% federal ITC for solar is due to step down to 10% at the end of 2016.    Analysts say there is a possibility that the North Carolina legislature will revisit elements of the state tax incentive for renewables in 2016 or 2017 and potentially revive it.    In any case, they expect larger ground-mounted PV projects will advance through next year as utilities operating in North Carolina are required to meet a state renewables mandate - the only one in the southeast.    Partly for that reason, as much as 500MW of PV generation build-out is possible in 2016 alone. North Carolina ranks fourth among states nationwide with more than 1GW of installed solar capacity. After California, it ranked second in 2014 with 397MW in new capacity with several hundred megawatts more expected this year.    Dominion North Carolina Power will purchase the power from the $45m Whitakers project under a long-term contract.     We are pleased to contribute to Dominions renewable energy portfolio and play a role in providing North Carolinians with affordable clean energy, says Ecoplexus chief executive John Gorman."
13464,Farm-Way Inc.,Solar PV," Farm-Way of Bradford, VT Goes Solar","Farm-Way Inc. has joined Vermonts growing list of companies that have made the switch to solar power. Installed by White River Junction-based groSolar, the solar solution will generate almost 60 kilowatts of electricity for the company  almost half its energy consumption.    In this economy, investing in solar power is a simple, smart business decision, said Farm-Way Co-Owner Skip Metayer. This system is also good for the planet - it keeps 76,000 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere per year, that's like taking 11 passenger cars off the road for a year. We hope other area businesses will join us and go solar as well.    Farm-Way received financial assistance from the Vermont Clean Energy Development Fund, a renewable energy loan program run by the Vermont Department of Public Service.    The 26-year-old clothing company is family-owned and operated in Bradford, and has grown to include a robust online business and more than $4 million in inventory, with online sales expected to grow in the coming decade.    The installation is already paying back faster than we ever anticipated, said Metayer. In the next five years, we are hoping to go completely off-grid, and maybe even make a little extra energy. I dont get excited about much, but when I can see that we are making more electricity than were using, its a pretty good feeling.    The system, to be unveiled June 12 in a ceremony with Governor Jim Douglas, will provide nearly half the power used by the outfitters 12,000 sq. foot headquarters, which employs 36 people. Solar power has rapidly become an attractive investment proposition for companies of all sizes in Vermont as costs have come down and renewable-energy production incentives have gone up. The recent passage of H.446 will only increase this trend as the bill sets more favorable rates for small-scale solar production similar to Farm-Ways.    groSolar CEO Jeff Wolfe has been a vocal supporter of the legislation. groSolar is the fastest growing tech company in Vermont, and the worlds largest exclusively U.S. owned solar distributor.    Im always happy to see local companies realizing that solar is in step with Vermont traditions like community and self-sufficiency, said groSolars Commercial Project Manager, Kevin McCollister. Farm-Way is a family-owned and operated business that spans three generations. By choosing solar, they are taking steps to secure the next generations future.    A ribbon-cutting ceremony will take place on June 12 at 2 p.m. at Farm-Ways Bradford location at 286 Waits River Rd. Governor Douglas will be in attendance, and the event will include music and refreshments. Representatives from Farm-Way and groSolar will also be speaking."
7396,Santa Cruz City Schools - Soquel High School I,Solar PV, groSolar Helps Soquel High School Tap the Sun's Power,"Two powerful motivators have driven Soquel High School to get their electricity from the sun instead of more traditional sources. First, financial incentives in California make the green power an attractive choice that will save the school money immediately. And perhaps more importantly is that this change is in line with the schools mission to motivate students to contribute responsibly to society. By setting the example of helping to protect the environment the school is able to show student first hand the economic and environmental impacts of solar electricity.    The solar power project, which was built by groSolar, was turned on December 18. This is the largest solar PV project in the county and one of the largest school projects in California at 315kW.    The system is comprised of more than 1,800 photovoltaic (PV) panels from Suntech Power, and will produce 40% of the schools electricity.    Besides saving money, the school board was interested in solar because of the positive impact Soquels solar system will have on the environment, said Assistant Superintendent Dick Moss. Moss was also proud to note that the schools students will be using web-based data from the solar system for study purposes in science and math.    This is an especially fulfilling project for us, said Jeff Wolfe, groSolar CEO. This project will allow the next generation of scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs to witness the environmental and economic values of solar firsthand. groSolar leads in many ways, but I cannot think of a more important area for solar than schools.    In addition to groSolars involvement, MP2 Capital was instrumental in creating and developing the project. Construction began in September of this year and was completed in late December."
24633,Albuquerque Academy,Solar PV, Here Comes the Sun! Solar Array Construction Underway,"Joining a growing number of schools and colleges across the country, Albuquerque Academy will soon become home to a one megawatt DC photovoltaic solar array  most likely the largest secondary school solar project to date in the U.S.  and fully funded by companies outside the school.    Located on 5 acres of land east of the tennis courts, the array will be the maximum size facility allowed under New Mexico utility regulations. Following nearly three years of planning and negotiations, the array will be completed this year and become operational on January 1, 2011. The array represents a mutually beneficial collaboration between the Academy and a number of parties. The result: a dramatic reduction in the Academy's energy costs and carbon footprint.    The $5 million array will provide the Academy with more than 2 million kilowatt hours annually, approximately one-quarter of the school's annual electricity use. The Academy will serve as a ""solar host"" for the array that will be financed and constructed by third-parties, capturing the tax incentives available only to for-profit companies. The non-profit school will recognize substantial savings by paying a low price for the electricity compared to what would be paid for grid power. Annual savings to the Academy are expected to increase over the twenty-year life of the project providing a predictable and stable economic hedge against rising electricity costs. Beyond twenty years, the Academy will own the array that is expected to continue to produce electricity for many more years.    Conversations about building a solar array on campus land began in December, 2007 when parent Mike Mattioli visited with Head of School Andrew Watson to talk about how solar hosting agreements can assist non-profit organizations otherwise unable to benefit from the tax credits and incentives that are moving this technology forward. What followed was close to three years of creative thinking and planning to structure a power purchase agreement between the Academy and Rockwell Financial Group (an independent finance company specializing in energy project finance). Other companies involved include Consolidated Solar Tech (Mr. Mattioli's company), Conergy (a leading global renewable energy company with two New Mexico offices), Mosher Enterprises (an Albuquerque company), Schott Solar (a German company with an Albuquerque manufacturing plant), and Unirac (an Albuquerque company that designs and builds the mounting racks for the solar modules).    Academy Treasurer Gary Gordon '79 and Business Manager for Finance and Facilities Pam Scanlon were instrumental in working with these companies to develop the project. Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) will continue to provide regular service to the Academy, and interface with the solar facility. Even when the school is on holiday, however, the array's electricity will be used entirely on campus. Unlike some solar systems, none of the electricity will be sold to the grid. Once the array is operational, Draker Laboratories will provide close monitoring of energy production and carbon footprint reduction.    Because construction costs for the array won't impact the Academy's annual budget, cost savings can go to supporting school life, including other sustainability projects. Construction of the solar array will place the Academy at the forefront of a technology that is growing rapidly in the United States, and the facility will serve as a model for other independent schools and non-profit organizations across the country.    It is difficult to imagine a project with as many positive outcomes, from the environmental and economic impact it will make on the Academy and the region, to the educational opportunities it will provide for students and community members. Watch for more news and photos as construction of the solar array is completed, as well as for information on a start-up celebration to be held in January."
40009,"Eastover Farm, LLC",Solar PV, Opposition to solar farms mounts in Cape Fear region,"A thriving solar industry has flocked to the flat farmland of southeastern North Carolina, bringing jobs and pumping tax revenue into some of the state's poorest counties.    But in recent months, signs have pointed to growing opposition to solar farms. Town leaders, neighbors and farmers are showing up at meetings to voice worries over possible toxins, health risks and property values, sometimes outnumbering supporters for the industry.    In two cases, opponents have succeeded in blocking new solar farms in Robeson and Scotland counties.    A lawyer for landowners who were denied a permit last week by the Robeson County Board of Commissioners says the unfounded worries are putting in jeopardy a lucrative industry.    ""Every solar company's eyes are on this decision,"" said Mark Brooks, whose clients sought a conditional-use permit to allow 26,000 solar panels off N.C. 130 near Rowland. ""I think we can say goodbye to green energy. I think we can say goodbye to solar panel companies.""    In a separate case, the Laurinburg Planning Board on March 12 denied the same company, Strata Solar of Chapel Hill, a permit for panels off U.S. 501.    Both boards had approved similar solar arrays in the past. But more opponents are showing up to hearings.    ""Can you imagine what (the companies) will do if they find that a permit was denied?"" Brooks asked. ""Not on the basis of sound material evidence, but on the basis of fear and speculation?""    To Rowland Mayor Elizabeth Hunt, the concerns aren't unfounded.    ""It's not an issue of trust. It's not technology lagging behind. It's the unknown,"" Hunt told Robeson County commissioners during the April 1 hearing on the Strata farm. She said she read that materials in the panels contained toxins that could leak into groundwater or sewer systems.    ""We've been talking about solar farms in Robeson County since 2007,"" Hunt said. ""That's just about five years. We ask that you do consider the long-term health issues.""    Hunt, whose town was hit by a tornado in April 2011, said she worried about what would happen if another natural disaster occurred.    ""Who is responsible for the damage if another tornado comes through and debris from this farm is strewn throughout the town?"" she said.    Walter Hodge, whose property abuts the proposed site, said he and his wife have lived in Rowland for more than 40 years.    ""There has never been a study to see if they're safe or not,"" Hodge said. ""Never. I've been on the Internet. I've been everywhere looking for one. There's not one.""    Solar companies say their operations are safe.    ""A solar farm has no moving parts,"" said Gerry Dudzik, project developer for the proposed Rowland farm. ""It uses sunlight as fuel, and as a result, there is no noise, no emissions associated with the operation of the farm.""    There is no evidence of leaking toxins, ground erosion or any effect on property values, the industry says.    Strata, which has six farms in Robeson, Hoke and Columbus counties, was caught off guard by the permit denials. Robeson commissioners had approved four other permits for Strata in Shannon, St. Pauls, Maxton and Rowland.    Blair Schoof, vice president of marketing for Strata, said the company plans to appeal Robeson County's decision.    ""We still feel Robeson County has been a great place to do business,"" Schoof said. ""So far, we've been well received by the county and the towns we've worked in.""    Strata submitted site plans to officials in Red Springs on Wednesday to build another farm there. Red Springs Mayor John McNeill said the town has worked with Strata for nearly a year, and he calls the plan a ""win-win."" He doesn't expect opposition from residents.    ""I'm sure they'll be curious and will have some questions that we'll have to answer,"" McNeill said.    Another company, O2 Energies of Cornelius, is expanding into Robeson County, too. Last month, the commissioners approved an application for the company's third solar array in the county. Commissioner Jerry Stephens was the only opponent to that permit, saying it was near his childhood home.    ""You can't pull them up once you've put them down,"" Stephens said. ""I'm not comfortable with it.""    Joel Olsen, managing director of O2 Energies, said the board's denial of the Strata permit hasn't given him pause about continuing work in the county, but industries must educate and listen to the community.    ""Our experience in Robeson County, they have been forward-looking,"" Olsen said. ""Like any development, it's important to look at the community and find the right location.""    Major N.C. industry  Solar power is part of a $3.7 billion clean energy industry in the state that has created an estimated 15,200 jobs. An industry association says 1,100 clean energy companies now do business in 86 of 100 counties.    Strata Solar says each of its solar farms in Robeson County produces enough energy to power about 750 homes a year. The electricity is fed into power grids for utilities.    A three- to four-month installation of a solar farm involves about 120 workers and generates more than $250,000 in wages, lodging and supplies. Each farm adds $15 million to the property tax base, Strata said.    Solar companies say their investments can lead to ancillary industries such as manufacturing. Unemployment in Robeson County was 12.9 percent as of February, among the highest in the state.    Concerns voiced  When Strata went before the Laurinburg Planning Board in March for a permit, residents brought up complaints similar to the Rowland case. They said they worried about the visibility of the panels and drainage causing harm to surrounding farmland. Six residents showed up to oppose it; the only supporters were project representatives.    The board voted unanimously to recommend denial of the permit.    Laurinburg already has two solar farms, said Brandi Deese, the planning and development director.    ""We did not foresee the kind of opposition we saw at the Planning Board meeting,"" she said.    The City Council will consider Strata's permit at a public hearing Tuesday.    ""A lot of it is the fear of the unknown,"" Deese said."
26975,Darden Restaurants HQ,Solar PV, Projects: Kenyon Energy: Darden Restaurant Headquarters,"DECK Monitoring tracks inverter-direct output data and provides revenue-grade production metering for each 260 kW inverter and the electrical combination panel of the six 5 kW SMA inverters. Environmental monitoring includes ambient temperature, cell temperature, irradiance, humidity, barometric pressure, and wind speed and direction    The 1.1 MW Darden restaurant headquarters system is currently the largest privately owned PV installation in Florida. The array is composed of a custom galvanized steel solar canopy mounted over an existing parking garage, and a ballasted roof-mounted system installed on the Darden restaurant support center building. Combined, a total of 4,404 SolarWorld 250 W modules are deployed across these two arrays. Several factors played a role in making this a complex project from the conceptual design phase through system commissioning.    The most unique feature is the solar canopy structure that was built on top of the four-story, 85,000-squarefoot parking garage, which is located in Floridas 120-mph wind zone. This canopy structure also supports vertically mounted solar modules in landscape format on the east-, south- and westfacing portions of the structure. These vertically mounted modules serve as an architectural facade that shields the canopys supporting galvanized steel trusses and girders when Dardens employees and campus visitors view the structure from ground level.    Optimizing the rooftop PV systems power performance ratio while keeping the total roof dead load below 5.5 pounds per square foot, and keeping a roof membrane penetration-free in a high wind zone was a complex challenge to manage. Various racking solutions were considered, but ultimately DPW Solars POWER-FAB CRS solution was selected. The CRS racking system secured the solar modules at an optimal 15° tilt angle. The array was laid out parallel to the buildings south edge, which has an azimuth of 147°. This approach allowed for a greater module-to-roof density ratio and provided an aesthetically pleasing installation while optimizing the systems annual performance."
40009,"Eastover Farm, LLC",Solar PV, Solar Farm on Agenda,"Laurinburg City Council will meet tonight to officially install new Fire Chief Randy Gibson.    The city announced last week that Gibson had been selected to succeed part-time fire chief John Evans following his retirement at the first of this year.    He was the best choice by far, said Laurinburg Mayor Tommy Parker, who will administer Gibsons oath of office.    Prior to being hired to the job Gibson served as a lieutenant and chief fire inspector.    Evans also served as chief of police, a role currently being filled by interim Chief Kimothy Monroe.    No firm timetable has been set for hiring a permanent replacement to that office.    Also during tonights meeting the city will set a date for the public hearing to discuss the construction of a solar farm on Johns Road/US 15-501 Bypass near the wealthy Balmoral subdivision. Following complaints from a number of residents, the citys planning board voted unanimously to recommend that the city council not approve the construction of the farm.    The farm would be installed by Chapel Hill-based Strata Solar, a firm which has previously been granted the right to build in the city.    According to Jay Cobb of Strata, the company has 16 solar farms totaling 78 megawatts already, with a further seven currently under construction.    During the planning board meeting Cobb explained that the five megawatt farm being proposed inside the city would not exceed 10 feet in height and would require very little maintenance. Construction, which would take about three months to complete, would commence immediately following an approval by council, said Cobb.    Several city residents were critical of the proposed farm during the planning board meeting, offering concerns about aesthetics as well as drainage and erosion.    Balmoral Subdivision resident Mike Coughenour told the board that he was in favor of solar farms in general but said that Balmoral is not the place for one, adding that he does not want to look out his window and see one.    Laurinburg resident Richard Pate spoke in agreement, saying that solar farms should be placed in more rural areas.    That public hearing will likely be set by council for April 16.    Council is not expected to discuss the solar farm during tonights meeting.    Also during the meeting, council is scheduled to receive the results of an electric rate study conducted by the McGavran and Associates firm.    The study will recommend adjustments to the citys electric rate schedule and allow council to see how the city stacks up against other cities in its electric billing.    Former City Manager Ed Burchins initiated the study last year."
42319,PSEG Meadows Solar Energy Centre (FKA Meadows PV1),Solar PV, Solar Frontiers CIS PV modules selected for a 26 MW project in North Carolina,"Solar Frontier K.K. (Tokyo, Japan) the worlds largest CIS solar photovoltaic (PV) solutions provider, on September 1st, 2015 announced that it will supply CIS PV modules, for a 26 MW project located near Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.A.    Solar Frontier signed the module supply agreement with a California-based solar equipment supplier and initiated the first of a series of shipments in late August, the company reports.    The project will be constructed by Vaughn Industries, a team of full service electrical contractor specialists (including power transmission and distribution, substation and renewable energy projects).    Solar Frontier is pleased to add this project to our growing footprint in the Americas and, as we expand our presence in the market, to add Vaughn Industries to our expanding network of trusted national construction leaders, commented Charles Pimentel, COO of Solar Frontier Americas.    Solar Frontier is a company whose product we recognize and value for its quality production and high-performance in the field, added Tim Vaughn, CEO of Vaughn Industries, LLC."
